I'm an associate professor in the [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr).
Prior to joining KAIST, I worked as a research scientist at [AITRICS](https://www.aitrics.com). I finished my PhD in computer science & engineering department at Pohang university of Science & Technology (POSTECH) under the supervision of Professor [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin/), and did my postdoc in [Computational Statistics & Machine Learning group at Univsersity of Oxford](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk) with
Professor [Fran√ßois Caron](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/).

My [CV](cv.pdf) (updated Sep. 2023).

## Research Interests
- Bayesian deep learning
- Bayesian nonparametric models
- Generative models
- Meta learning

## For prospective students
I'm seeking self-motivated students who are interested in machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian methods. Currently, I only advise students who are enrolled in the Kim Jaechul graduate school of AI. If you want to work with me, I encourage you to reaching out to me early, ideally two or three months before the grad school admission deadline and work on research projects under my supervision.
