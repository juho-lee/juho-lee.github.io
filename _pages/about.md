I'm an assistant professor in the [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](http://gsai.kaist.ac.kr).
Prior to joining KAIST, I worked as a research scientist at [AITRICS](https://www.aitrics.com). I finished my PhD in computer science & engineering department at Pohang university of Science & Technology (POSTECH) under the supervision of Professor [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin/), and did my postdoc in [Computational Statistics & Machine Learning group at Univsersity of Oxford](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk) with
Professor [Fran√ßois Caron](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/).

My [CV](files/cv.pdf) (updated Aug. 2020).

## Research Interests
- Bayesian deep learning & deep Bayesian learning
- Bayesian nonparametric models
- Random graph models

## For prospective students
I'm looking for self-motivated students interested in machine learning / deep learning / Bayesian methods. For now, I only advise students in the graduate school of AI at KAIST, so please get an admission before contacting me. I strongly recommend to contact me in advance (at least two or three months earlier than the grad school admission deadline) and conduct a research project with me.
